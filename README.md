# Noughts-And-Crosses
This is a simple game of noughts and crosses.


## FYI the code doesn't currently work, however I will fix it by tonight.

This version of noughts and crosses is also compatible with versions of python 3.4.x+
This is because the computers at my school only support up to python 3.4.0
